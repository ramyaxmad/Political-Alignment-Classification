    "In this part, I am performing K-means clustering on both the bag of words and TF-IDF vector models seperately. Each vector can be classified as left, center, or right leaning, with rows [0, 46] classified as left, [47, 95] classified as center, and [95, 134] classified as right. I begin the classification by initializing three cluster centers, with one center assigned to a random left-aligned vector, another as a random center-aligned vector, and the last as a random right-aligned vector. I then iterate through each row, calculate the cosine similarity between each row and each of the cluster centers, then group the row into the cluster with the highest similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue with this is the assumption that similar political orientations use the same kind of words. However, imagine a large number of right leaning articles have similar words to the vector chosen for the left cluster center and different words from the vector chosen for the right cluster center. In this case, there would be a large number of right leaning vectors in the left cluster. When the center of the cluster is recalculated, the recalculated center no longer describes a left leaning vector. Therefore, the bag of words and TF-IDF vector models are not an accurate measure for unsupervised clustering."
