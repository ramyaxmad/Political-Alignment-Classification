00:43 dailywire.com/subscribe Folks what we are watching right now is one of the most cynical uncoverings of scandal in
00:48 the history of American politics It really is an amazing amazing thing So why don't we begin with this obviously
00:54 our hearts go out to the former president of the United States Joe Biden who's been diagnosed with metastatic
00:60 prostate cancer The diagnosis of course has now been revealed just months after he left office And everybody has been
01:07 expressing their good wishes for the Biden family and for Joe Biden personally Obviously the announcement of
01:13 stage four cancer which is what Joe Biden apparently has It's metasta prostate cancer that moved apparently
01:18 from the prostate all the way into his bones It's an aggressive form of prostate cancer The statement went out
01:25 3:56 p.m Sunday afternoon Apparently having been seen by medical professionals earlier last week
01:30 for a finding of a prostate nodule he was diagnosed Friday with stage 4 prostate cancer with metastasis to the
01:36 bone an aggressive form of the disease There's a 10-point scale The so-called Gleason score is a nine on a 10point
01:43 scale It doesn't mean that he is definitely terminal Prostate cancer moves slowly Metastatic means that of
01:50 course it has moved already from its original source to someplace else in the body Once you have cancer in your bones
01:56 obviously the prognosis is not good It doesn't mean it's necessarily deadly in the next couple of months or anything
02:01 like that Barack Obama put out a statement saying "Michelle and I are thinking of the entire Biden family
02:06 Joseph Fighter I know he will face this challenge with the same strength resilience and optimism that have always defined his life That is Kla Harris
02:14 Donald Trump President Trump wrote on Truth Social." Melania and I are saddened to hear about Joe Biden's recent medical diagnosis We extend our
02:19 warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family and wish a fast and successful recovery Now obviously everybody's heart
02:26 goes out to somebody who is stricken with cancer We have to ask the obvious
02:31 question who knew this and when did they know this prostate cancer is not a fast-moving cancer Prostate cancer
02:38 usually takes years to develop to the point of metastasis It is very slowm moving cancer actually which is why
02:45 usually I asked my doctor wife about this when it comes to sort of standard of care there's a little bit more wiggle
02:51 room on when prostate exams are done or when PSA tests are done which is
02:56 effectively a form of blood test in which they can see certain elevated counts that that lead to a suspicion
03:03 that you may have cancer or not But when I asked my wife about this yesterday she
03:09 said "When was his last physical?" His last recorded physical The answer was February 2024 was his last recorded physical His last recorded physical did
03:16 not include a PSA test She said "That's definitely weird I mean he's the president of the United States so you
03:21 would do as much of a workup panel as you possibly could This is not like your average 82y old guy or 81y old guy where
03:27 okay maybe you check for PSA maybe you don't." In fact as people get older sometimes people don't check the PSA
03:33 because it's such a slowmoving cancer That the suggestion is that by the time
03:38 the cancer actually would kill you you'd be dead anyway of old age With that said as people are living older and older
03:44 older if you're in your 80s there's a pretty good shot that they're going to do a PSA So I didn't want to rely on
03:49 just my own medical expertise or my wife's medical expertise I also asked our friends and sponsors at Perplexity
03:55 given the fact that President Biden was diagnosed with stage four prostate cancer with metastasis to his bones how
04:01 long was he likely suffering from cancer before his May 2025 diagnosis also what
04:06 is the standard for PSA testing for men above the age of 50 in the United States so here is what perplexity tells me
04:12 Former President Biden was diagnosed with stage 4 prostate cancer with bone metastasis in May 2025 characterized by
04:17 a Gleon score of nine indicating a highly aggressive cancer While the exact timeline of his cancer progression is
04:22 unclear metastatic prostate cancer typically develops over several years High-grade cancers often progress faster
04:29 with studies suggesting metastasis can occur within 2 to 5 years if untreated
04:34 Again two to five years didn't develop over the course of the last year Biden's diagnosis followed increasing urinary
04:40 symptoms and the discovery of a prostate nodule which underscores the importance of early detection So what are the
04:45 standards well it turns out that the US preventative services task force says
04:51 there are individualized decisions for age 55 to 69 and no routine screening after 70 But Medicare covers annual PSA
04:58 tests for anyone over 50 Medicare and as my wife I did ask her you know PSA
05:04 testing She's a family physician She said literally every physical that I did
05:10 for anybody over the age of 50 I recommended that they may as well get a PSA test So it bears the imagination
05:15 that Joe Biden did not have one The notion that there was no knowledge whatsoever of developing cancer in Joe
05:22 Biden for years on end And we only found out about this This is only diagnosed at stage 4 Typically when you have a stage
05:28 4 cancer diagnosis and it's sudden it is not a prostate cancer diagnosis That is
05:33 typically some much faster form of cancer that has developed And again this is not just me saying this because I am
05:40 not a doctor But you know who is a doctor Dr Dr Ezekiel Emanuel is the left's favorite doctor He's one of the designers of Obamacare And he appeared
05:47 on Morning Joe this morning And here is what he had to say about when Joe Biden and family and people around him would
05:53 have known about a deadly cancer forming inside the president And and this raises all sorts of questions about number one
06:00 when people knew Number two if they didn't know were they deliberately avoiding tests that theoretically could
06:06 have led to a better standard of care for the president of the United States in order to get him through the election
06:12 this all ties into the broader scandal about the fact that he's obviously in the midst of sinility They knew this
06:18 during the campaign There's open talk of him having to use a wheelchair after he was elected And so again this
06:24 announcement actually raises more questions than it answers If the idea here was that they were going to drop this cancer announcement as a way of
06:31 sort of distracting from the questions about his celility and and again that theory is out there and that theory is
06:36 not totally crazy considering the fact that you have people like David Axelrod openly suggesting that now would be an
06:42 amazing time to stop talking about all of this because absolut because obviously you have a president who's
06:48 ailing and that's really bad and so you have people literally saying like David Axelrod the former Obama adviser that we
06:55 should stop talking about medicine because he has cancer That's ridiculous That's ridiculous That actually this
07:02 creates more questions I mean this is a scandal I'm sorry It's just an absolute scandal Everybody knew in 2020 that Joe
07:08 Biden was not full well Everyone knew this And then we were told by the media for years He was not scenile There was
07:14 no evidence of senility And now we're finding out of course not only was he scenile everybody knew he was scenile As we'll see in a moment there's actual
07:20 tape of him in an interview with special prosecutor Robert Herur This was the
07:25 tape that made Robert Her say "We can't prosecute this guy because he's too scenile." And the Democrats at the time said "No no no no no That's Robert Her
07:32 being a jerk." That's terrible that Robert her would say that So they all knew he was scenile Now the question is
07:37 do they all know that he had cancer or if they didn't know that he had cancer how did nobody know that he had cancer this is again not a fastmoving form of
07:44 cancer This is the kind of cancer that it takes 10 years to develop That's not me saying that That is Dr Ezekiel Emanuel saying that Here he was on MSNBC
07:52 Doesn't it take uh some time uh for prostate cancer to develop to a point
07:58 where it would spread to the bones oh he's had this for uh many years maybe
08:04 even a decade growing there uh and spreading That's right Um it's a little
08:11 surprising Um I look back at the records and there's no evidence that when he got
08:16 his health uh status and uh the the medical records were released that he
08:22 had a prostate specific antigen Now it is true that a lot of people recommend
08:27 not doing a prostate specific aden after 70 but uh President Biden's been in
08:33 public life a very long time He was vice president and had a lot of exams under 70 So it's a little surprising uh that
08:40 they didn't do it and maybe uh President Biden decided he didn't want the test Okay that is crazy Okay he's saying what
08:47 I was saying a moment ago which is he was the vice president of the United States Then he was the president of the United States The notion that you would
08:53 not do a PSA test which is a very easy test to do You wouldn't do a PSA test on the sitting president of the United
08:58 States a person who by the way apparently had a history of cancer Joe Biden himself said in 2022 he said he
09:05 had cancer in 2022 And then they said "Oh he meant he meant that a while ago he had skin cancer." Is that what he meant is that what he meant here he was
09:12 in 2022 And because it was a four-lane highway that was accessible my mother drove us
09:20 And rather than us be able to walk And guess what the first frost you know what
09:26 was happening you had to put on your windshield wipers to get literally the oil slick off the window That's why I
09:33 and so damn many other people I grew up have cancer Um what what I mean he said that in 2022
09:42 and everybody went wait what is he talking about right now wait which what what now huh well which cancer was he
09:50 talking about okay beyond that here is the bottom line for all of this These questions are perfectly legitimate The
09:56 entire media are going to now mobilize to say you cannot ask these questions A tragedy has occurred You cannot ask these questions Absolutely you can ask
10:02 these questions Absolutely You should ask these questions because we now have a series of questions Dr Jill Biden okay she was
10:10 there the whole time She knew She was She doesn't have any excuses She knew he
10:15 was going scenile Everyone knew he was going scenile And yet she continued like Edith Wilson to promote his presidential
10:21 candidacy the entire time I mean two weeks ago she had him out on tour on the
10:27 View He was daughtering He couldn't he could barely speak a sentence And she was finishing his sentences on The View
10:32 who's still trotting out What kind of person does that to their alien husband who does that that's wild That's Where's
10:38 the rest of Joe Biden's family where's Hunter where's Beloved Hunter in all of this where are his kids where who Why
10:45 was there no one around him to say no you can't do this not just on the basis of his senelity but now maybe on the
10:53 basis of the fact that he apparently has a deadly cancer The overall chance that a person diagnosed with metastatic
10:59 prostate cancer is alive after 5 years around 37% according to the American Cancer Society So who knew this when did
11:05 they know this why did we not know this and by the way who the hell was president for the last several years i
11:11 mean that's a serious question He had physical problems He had mental problems And we were told the Democratic Party
11:17 tried to make this person president for another full term They tried to make him president for another full term How
11:24 delusional is this so delusional that some people still have the delusion James Klyber who is
11:30 the congressman from South Carolina who more than any other person made sure that Joe Biden was the nominee in 2020
11:35 as opposed to Bernie Sanders Yesterday he said that Joe Biden was fit for four more years By what
11:42 standard was Joe Biden fit for four more days here was James Klyber
11:48 Do you think that Joe Biden really would have been able to perform as president all the way through January 2029 when he
11:56 would have been when he would be 86 yes I thought that back then Uh I
12:04 still think that uh but I don't know that Uh when people ask me did I know
12:10 this or did I know the other and the fact of the matter is no I didn't Uh and that's you make my point here So it's
12:16 not all about age Uh I've seen uh people develop Alzheimer's uh when they're in
12:24 their 30s and 40s So it's not about age It's about uh the ability to do the job
12:30 And I never saw anything that allowed me to think that that Joe Biden was not
12:35 able to do the job Okay So I mean my goodness my goodness
12:41 And we'll get to the sility issue in just a minute because all this stuff ties together Now again there were people who actually were talking about
12:47 this a while ago There were people who were talking about this in 2024 So for
12:53 example there were there was in fact a report in 2024 of a serious medical
12:59 issue involving Joe Biden This from July 22nd 2024 Jordan Shel reporting that
13:05 President Biden began his campaign trip in Las Vegas But the day before he abruptly left town he delivered a
13:12 keynote address in front of a packed crowd of 5,000 people at the NAACP National Convention at the Mandalay Bay Hotel He was scheduled to deliver the
13:18 keynote at another annual convention at the MGM Grand but he didn't appear at the convention or any of the scheduled events later that afternoon Instead he
13:25 left town departing Las Vegas on Air Force One for a Hobok Beach Delaware where he
13:30 remained Since that trip he had announced over social media he would not seek a second term as president So they
13:36 suggested it was because of CO 19 but actually as Charlie Kirk at the time had
13:42 reported that there was a he said he got a call from a source close to Las Vegas Metro The official story was that
13:48 Biden's trip was cut short because of CO But according to the source US Secret Service informed Las Vegas Metro there
13:54 was an emergency situation involving Joe Biden and that they had to close necessary streets so the president could
13:59 be transported immediately to University Medical which they began to do in earnest And then there was a standown
14:05 order and Secret Service informed local Vegas PD they were going to fly the president to Johns Hopkins back east
14:11 Apparently the rumor mill in the police department was that Joe Biden was dying or possibly already dead Hey Laura
14:17 Loomer of course also tweeted at the time suggesting that the president had a terminal illness So again who knew what
14:25 when i find it extraordinarily difficult to believe like bordering on the
14:30 impossible to believe that no one knew about Joe Biden and his cancer until
14:35 like last week I find that impossible to believe truly that is a slowm moving
14:42 cancer This is a president who must have been tested over and by the way we should change the law Seriously the law
14:49 should be changed with regard to presidential health advisories and
14:54 notifications and public disclosure It is not just a matter of
14:60 medical privacy how the president is doing That is a matter of national security and it matters to the American
15:05 voters The president should be required should of both parties The president should be required make a full panled
15:12 health test every year and we should know about it We the American people we are owed that We should know whether the
15:18 president has cancer We should know whether the president has a mental condition We should know whether the president has high blood pressure It
15:24 shouldn't be up to the handpicked doctor of the presidents of the United States to cover up his health condition That is
15:30 a violation of the bargain that the American people have with their elected leaders I mean this is it's unbelievable
15:37 truly And again that does not stand in the way of sympathy for a man who has cancer The question I have is why didn't anyone seem to have sympathy for him
15:43 over the course of the last two years when he was obviously ailing in the middle of public life It's
15:50 unreal It's absolutely unreal And I I I just I I don't I don't
15:56 believe the story Sorry I don't I don't believe that you only found out that he had cancer last week Stage four
16:03 metastatic prostate cancer that takes years to develop I do not believe that
16:08 one of the most highly scrutinized people on planet Earth did not know that he had what is a fairly common cancer
16:14 for people of his age I I nope don't believe it We'll get to more on this in a moment First your online activity is

18:37 health condition generally speaking So to talk about that for a moment audio of
18:43 former President Biden his interview with special counsel Robert got a public airing on Friday afternoon So Axios
18:49 originally posted some segments of this audio and then they posted the full audio Okay this of course is an
18:55 interview that Joe Biden did with the special prosecutor Robert her You will recall that the left went insane about
19:02 this particular interview Why well because it turns out that Robert her
19:07 early on in 2024 put out an explanation for why Joe Biden was not being prosecuted for mishandling classified
19:14 documents And in that document where he explained why he wasn't going to prosecute Biden he said basically people
19:20 will see him in the jury as a well-meaning older man with memory issues which was a very nice way of
19:25 saying he's scenile And the entire left went insane How dare Robert Herr say this Robert her must be some sort of
19:31 Republican operative saying that the president of the United States has memory problems that he's scenile You
19:36 might recall Tommy Veer Obama van driver and adviser saying quote her claim that
19:42 Biden couldn't remember the day his son died was an outrageous lie It's also cruel and irrelevant Anyone who's
19:47 experienced loss like that can remember images smells bits of conversation The pain is burned into you Dates blend together because they're
19:54 irrelevant Okay and he was just one of the people who was leading the attack on Robert Herr for saying the perfectly obvious which is that the president of
19:60 the United States did not have a functioning brain Okay Well now we have the audio And guess what it turns out
20:06 Robert her was actually understating the case Robert her was being kind He said that he was a well-meaning elderly man
20:12 with memory issues Uh no This is a person who clearly had sinility Clearly
20:18 and obviously And again I asked the question where was Dr Jill where was the rest of his family honest to God I mean
20:27 c can you imagine the absolute kind of moral corruption that it would take to
20:32 have an alien member of your family in the most visible position in the world
20:38 and you keep him out there because what you still need to clear some cash if you're hunter or you still need to get a pardon or you just really really like
20:44 the power and you really want to be the person who's signing the autopen By the way who the hell was signing the autopen this is not a president who knew
20:51 what he was doing Who was the actual president of the United States for the last two years of his administration who that's a big unanswered question Who the
20:57 hell was the president cuz it wasn't this guy Here was Joe Biden talking to Robert her and not remembering when his
21:05 son died And so what was happening though what month
21:13 died uh god May 30th Uh in 2018 2015 he died I think 2015 I think
21:22 it's 2015 I'm not sure the months are but I think that was Yeah that's right
21:27 Mr President Oh my god He couldn't remember the year
21:32 Forget about the the month He couldn't remember the year that his son died I mean now anybody again with sort of a
21:39 functioning brain can put that together Even if you forget for a moment you can put that together pretty quickly If you
21:44 ask you the if you ask me for example the year that my children were born I can give you the years that my children were born and also the dates because I I
21:50 know my kids Okay But like that is not a matter of him struggling That that is a
21:57 matter of him not he has to be reminded by people around him the year his son died Again I don't think that's because
22:03 the images were so deeply ingrained in his memory that the dates didn't matter I think it's because he couldn't remember Here he was He can't remember
22:10 when when Donald Trump was elected Here's the audio
22:15 and Trump gets elected in November of 2017 2016 16 2016 All right
22:28 So why do I have 2017 here that's when you left office January of 2017 Okay
22:37 Unbelievable has to be reminded why he has 2017 on the paper Even after he's told the date that Trump is elected
22:43 November 2016 he says "So why is it why does it say on the paper 20?" This is someone who was ailing He was ailing in
22:50 2023 Everyone knew it Everyone around him and his family put him out there anyway His staff put him out there
22:57 anyway By the way how much do they hate Kla Harris and my goodness they were so desperate to ensure that Kla Harris was
23:03 never president that they propped this person up as the president of the United States and tried to make him run for
23:09 another term Remember that is October of 2023 That was a year before the next election and they still tried to prop
23:15 that guy up I I have another question Who the hell around him allowed him to
23:20 do that debate with Donald Trump i mean you want to talk about political malpractice Who allowed him to do that
23:26 that's insane He was out there going "I'm going to take on Donald." And meanwhile in the back room they're all going "Wait wait This is the same guy
23:32 who couldn't remember the year his son died or the year Donald Trump was elected he's going to take on Donald Trump in a debate Truly like that's it."
23:40 And remember folks if he had not fully collapsed in that debate he still would have been running He never would have
23:45 dropped Here was Joe Biden being totally unable to put together a coherent sentence in that special prosecutor
23:51 interview [Music]
23:58 that I was still in the Senate
24:04 Anyway
24:09 remember there was pressure not pressure Bo knew how much I adored
24:17 him And uh I know this sounds maybe this sounds
24:25 so everybody knew how close we were There was not anybody in the world who
24:30 wondered whether or not anyway And so I'm wondering if it's a
24:38 good time to take a break then No I let me just keep going and get it done
24:44 Okay So literally that sounds like Robert Hurst saying "Sir do you want a break at this point?" Cuz you're kind of falling apart
24:50 here This was the person that they said was totally and remember the entire media lied to you They lied Okay because
24:57 you couldn't say they didn't know the specifics Fine They didn't know the specifics They saw the same thing we were saying but they didn't just say
25:02 what we were saying which is this person appears to be alien They said you were absolutely a Republican operative
25:08 vicious and mean if you pointed out what was perfectly obvious to the naked eye And they did so little investigation and
25:15 so little investigative reporting that they tried to prop this person up until he himself had to drop out of the race because it became perfectly obvious to
25:22 every sentient human being exactly what was happening with Joe Biden during that debate with Donald Trump That's the
25:27 scandals you have scandal along the line all I mean here is Joe Biden not being able to remember why he kept classified
25:34 information Remember this entire interview is why he had a bunch of classified information about Afghanistan
25:39 in his library like filed and with top secret stamped on it And here he
25:45 was Was this memo Mr President was this something that you consciously kept after your term as
25:53 vice president is this something that you wanted to hold on to i don't recall
25:58 Did I have this was this in my possession this memo yes To give you some context for this Mr President he
26:05 was found in the front of this notebook uh that's on the first page And the
26:10 notebook was found in the library at the lake house in one of the drawers Your
26:16 answer is you don't recall I don't recall how it got back I mean I don't recall how it got back in the book
26:23 because I sent it to the president I gave it to the president And this looks like the original I don't think there's
26:29 maybe a copy made of it but I don't think so It was faxed just to give you Oh okay That's why Yeah All right Now I
26:37 got it I wasn't sure how I got how I whether I g handed it to the president but it was facts to the president which
26:43 I had the copy right okay You had the original Yeah I had the original and I just put it in the book and that was it
26:49 Unbelievable Unbelievable I I even today the media are still covering this as though it's a Republicans pounce story
26:54 That's the way the media work When Democrats do a bad thing the story is Republicans pouncing When Republicans do a bad thing the story is Republicans
27:00 being bad When the Democrats do a bad thing it's Republicans pouncing So here is political reporting The audio fed
27:06 into ongoing Republican efforts to portray Biden as mentally unfit for the presidency at the end of his term and to
27:11 allege that Democrats hid that fact from the public Oh did it play into that did it well I mean I wonder how that could
27:17 have happened Maybe because it's true Maybe because it's true And again
27:22 it is absolutely incredible to me that the media tried to cover this up The media tried to cover this up everyone around him tried to cover it up I don't
27:29 believe for a second that Jake Sullivan did not know that Joe Biden was senile I do not believe for a hot second that Mike Donan didn't know that Joe Biden
27:35 was scenile I don't believe for a second that Joe Biden didn't know he was scenile and that he likely had cancer I don't believe any of that stuff because
27:42 I can't imagine in my own daily life dealing with people who are older than my parents like 10 years older than my
27:48 parents not knowing that stuff I first of all let's just be real about this As
27:53 you get older I've noticed this just as a as just a regular thing in life As you get older you end up talking about your health problems with your friends a lot
27:59 right because as you get older your body starts to not act the way there was when when you were 20 years old If you've ever been in a room with a bunch of
28:04 80-year-olds half the conversation is about health because it takes up a lot of their time and a lot of their life I
28:10 understand I get it The notion that none of this ever came up around Joe Biden the most powerful person on planet Earth
28:16 Honest to God we are lucky the world didn't explode even worse than it did under Joe Biden When you listen to this
28:21 when you realize his health condition we are we are honest to god lucky that
28:26 China didn't go for Taiwan while Joe Biden was president We are lucky that Russia didn't actually try to break NATO
28:32 outright not just attack Ukraine break NATO outright because my goodness this
28:38 is insane Totally insane President Trump asks a relevant question Whoever had control of the autoben is looking to be
28:44 a bigger and bigger scandal by the moment is a major real part of the crime that the presidential election of 2020
28:49 was rigged and stolen Millions and millions of people knew that but the radical left Democrats waged a campaign of inoculation and innocence like none
28:55 had ever been waged before This is why the unslect committee of political thugs who are given a full and complete pardon by the person who wielded the now
29:01 illegally used autopen deleted and destroyed all evidence and information from their corrupt and vicious witch hunt against me and many other people
29:07 whose lives were completely shattered and destroyed by the historically criminal event Okay so again the the
29:12 2020 election stuff about it being rigged and all that again you can say that it was rigged in the sort of informal sense that you had the media
29:18 covering things up that were relevant about Joe Biden and that part's true If what he means is that votes were changed and all again but that's not the issue
29:24 here The real question is who was the president of the United States who was
29:30 it i want to know Everyone ought to know Van Jones maybe the last honest Democrat
29:37 he said yesterday "We're going to pay for this cover up for a very long time as a party." I was shocked to see his condition when
29:44 he came out and so was the world And that wasn't the first time he was in that condition The book makes it very
29:50 very clear There are people who knew and said nothing And that is a crime against
29:56 this uh republic Uh and I think the Democrats are going to pay for a long time for being a part of what is now
30:02 being revealed to be a massive cover up Okay And Van Jones again he's being
30:08 honest about that I had a conversation with Van in the middle of the campaign and he was saying the same things So Van
30:13 has been honest about this for a very very long time Speaking of people who are not honest about this Senator Chris Murphy who's attempting a quixotic 2028
30:20 candidacy he was saying that the reason that Donald Trump is in the White House is because the Democrats didn't have the
30:26 balls to Biden Now there is some truth to that Imagine for a second that Joe Biden had actually been ousted from the
30:32 presidency not in the middle of 2024 but like in the middle of 2023 when
30:38 everybody knew that he was gone It turns out it was earlier than that But imagine that that Joe Biden 2 years into his
30:43 presidency had stepped out Kla Harris becomes the president and now you have open primaries in 2024 Does that change
30:49 the trajectory i think Donald Trump still wins but he's not wrong The Democrats tried to they tried to push
30:54 this horse over the finish line They propped Elsid like almost literally a dead body on the horse And it turns out
31:00 that it didn't work because then Kla Harris actually got her shot and she lost anyway in the most humiliating electoral defeat maybe of all time Here
31:07 is Senator Chris Murphy But ultimately in retrospect you can't defend what the Democratic party
31:13 did because we are stuck with a madman with a corrupt president in the Oval Office and we should have given our
31:19 ourselves a better chance to win Okay I mean the fact that he's admitting
31:25 it is kind of the whole thing Everyone everyone knew on a sort of colloquial casual level what was
31:31 going on But now what we are learning about the president's mental state what we are learning about the fact that he
31:37 had in fact a slow developing now deadly cancer you deep immorality It's not just
31:44 political malpractice which of course it is It is deep immorality Lying to the
31:49 American people in this way is deeply immoral Using an old man who is clearly in
31:55 ailing mental and physical health in order to get done your political job is just vile It really is And everyone
32:03 around him everyone who knew everybody who enabled this should be put out to political pasture as soon as humanly
32:09 possible I'm not just talking about members of the family obviously who who will be I'm talking about all the senators all the Congress people all the
32:16 political advisers This is a stain on the Democratic party It should be It's a stain on the media I mean you wonder why
32:22 the media's trust numbers have collapsed This is the reason the media's trust numbers have collapsed because for several years anytime anyone said "Hey
32:29 why don't you look into that?" Like "No no it's Republicans pouncing." Again it was never Republicans pouncing And the
32:35 saddest question the one that that honestly you you have to ask but it's really sad you even have to ask this
32:40 is if Joe Biden now has stage four deadly cancer twothirds of people who have it die within 5 years according to
32:47 the stats And if this was slow developing one of two things is true Either they knew and then they how did
32:55 they how did they treat him if they knew was he getting treatment all the time he was in the White House who was doing that treatment how did that not leak
33:02 okay that's that's number one Like the best possible scenario here just on a moral level is that they knew and that they got him the treatment that he
33:08 needed and the cancer just is winning That's the best possible And then there's the worst possible moral outcome
33:14 which is they knew he was ailing they knew he was old and they either specifically did not test him or they
33:19 did test him and didn't get him the treatment he needed because they needed him to remain in the presidency And that one is like the darkest possible moral
33:25 scenario here And all these questions are on the table and they should be on the table and pretending that it's some sort of grave evil to even ask the
33:32 question is nonsense It's nonsense As you know I'm not in the business of just asking questions here on the show I
33:38 don't like just asking questions meaning like throwing out speculation without any proper proof Okay the medical
33:43 evidence suggests not according to me according to every doctor that I've talked to this thing was slow developing
33:49 which means there was ample time to diagnose many people who could have known So either they did not do the PSA
33:56 test because for whatever reason they decided they didn't want to know the answer or they did the PSA test and they
34:02 probably knew the answer and then things get even darker from there This is an evidence-based question not a question
34:09 of just total speculation and it implicates everyone around him Between
34:14 the cancer story and the Senility story this is a nuclear bomb at the heart of the Democratic party and the heart of
34:20 the media and it absolutely should be treated as such We'll get to more on this in just one moment First if you're the owner of a growing business the way

36:41 Meanwhile the questions about the economy remain at kind of a a significant high at this point Moody's
36:48 put out a downgrade of American debt yesterday That that down rate in the credit rating was based on the fact that
36:56 Moody's is saying that we are just going to continue to blow out our debt That obviously is true but that's been true
37:01 for a very long time Moody's does have a political angle to it There's just no question about this Moody's is
37:06 constantly moving its ratings up and down in response to sort of political politics that you could best describe as
37:12 as a sort of center-left take on the world This notion that the debt was great and now that the Republicans are
37:18 going to pass a tax bill that basically continues the trajectory of debt along the lines it already was That that is what that really sinks the credit rating
37:24 That of course is really silly Now do we have a massive debt problem right now absolutely The 30-year yield on bonds
37:30 right now is really high like around 5% meaning that that is the rate that
37:36 investors are basically charging the government to take a 30-year bond which means significant uncertainty as to
37:42 whether they're going to get paid back in inflated dollars or whether it's even worthwhile to buy a 30-year bond That means that there's not a lot of faith in
37:48 the markets that 30 years from now the United States is going to have paid off its debt in fiscally responsible fashion
37:54 Now the Treasury Secretary Scott Bessant he says that Moody's is a lagging indicator Here he was yesterday
38:01 First of all I I think that Moody's is a lagging indicator I think that's what everyone thinks of credit agencies Larry
38:09 Summers and I don't agree on everything but he said that when they downgraded the US in
38:15 2011 So it's it's a lagging indicator
38:21 Okay it may be a lagging indicator but it is also true the United States has a massive debt problem that will be solved by neither party Basically the
38:27 Republicans and Democrats have decided that when it comes to the debt they're just going to shift around the chairs on the deck of the Titanic and fight over
38:32 who gets to do the shifting To be perfectly frank about all of this the death of the Tea Party you know the much
38:39 derided Paul Ryan Paul Ryan actually cared about this stuff He might be the last Republican leader who truly cared about this stuff in a serious way and
38:46 that was considered insufficient to the day And so he was ousted Meanwhile
38:51 Walmart has been warning that prices are likely going to rise because of the tariffs which is of course true When you
38:58 artificially increase the price of your inputs then the price of goods tends to rise as well So President Trump put out
39:05 a statement and again we may have to bring back good Trump bad Trump here because again he's doing so many things every single day that that there's a a
39:13 solid mix of good and bad from President Trump This one definitely falls into the bad Trump category President Trump put out a statement that says quote "Walmart
39:20 should stop trying to blame tariffs as the reason for rising prices throughout the chain." Walmart made billions of dollars last year far more than expected
39:26 Between Walmart and China they should as is said eat the tariffs and not charge valued customers anything I'll be
39:32 watching and so will your customers Okay Bernie Sanders calm down there Okay I'm
39:38 sorry that price mechanisms work according to market principles and that if you artificially boost the prices
39:43 people have to pay for things when they then use those things to sell to someone else the prices go up That of course is
39:49 the predictable result of artificially increasing the price of anything is that further down in the chain prices are going to rise and yelling at people for
39:56 prices rising is not good economic policy It's not good political policy I'm old enough to remember when Barack Obama did the exact same thing There
40:03 were people during when Obamacare was first passed who had put on bills how
40:08 much more you were paying for things because of Obamacare And the Obama administration got really mad They're like "How dare you inform people that
40:14 their prices are going up because of Obamacare?" And the answer was "Well yeah because you just stacked a new cost on people so now the prices are going to
40:21 go up When you stack a new cost on goods and services the prices go up." And yelling at Walmart to eat the tariffs is
40:29 is really quite foolish Again you want to say to the American people the prices need to go up to absorb temporary pain
40:34 so we can rejigger our trade relationship with China That at least is honest but eat the tariffs is a is a
40:41 ridiculous statement Eat the tariffs Come on And yes Walmart I'm sure is desperate to politically harm the
40:47 administration First of all the the family that owns Walmart is traditionally fairly Republican Second
40:53 Walmart is a lowcost store You think they want their prices to go up on their
40:59 consumers walmart's competitive advantage is that it undercharges pretty much everybody in the immediate area That's always been
41:05 the critique of Walmart is that it undercharges everybody like the local mom and pop stores And so now you're going to yell at them when the prices go
41:11 up It's silly It's bad economic policy I would expect it from Bernie Sanders I do
41:17 not expect that from the current president of the United States Scott Bessins again He has to do his best with
41:23 with the cards that he has dealt The Treasury Secretary says Walmart will eat some of the tariffs Listen I'm sure they will I'm sure that it won't all come out
41:29 in the pricing but come on I was on the phone with Doug McMillan
41:34 the CEO of Walmart yesterday and Walmart is in fact the going to the as you
41:41 describe it eat some of the tariffs Uh that just as they did in 18 19 and
41:52 20 Okay So again that that is fine but
41:58 try and pretend that there are no trade-offs in economic policy is of course very very silly And and the notion that we're out of the woods on
42:03 the trade war that obviously is untrue as well So yes we are negotiating some bilateral trade deals It will take a
42:09 while for all that to come out in the wash The current average tariff rates in the United States for incoming goods is
42:14 the highest it has been since 1932 Those are that those are additional costs on American consumers They are You
42:20 can make the policy case that we need to do that for whatever reason reassuring certain levels of manufacturing or boxing in China or whatever but at least
42:27 be honest with the American people about it Scott Bessant he says that countries are going to have to come to the table
42:33 even more I think one of the problems here is that there are a lot of countries who are coming saying like "Let's give you a 0% tariff rate." And
42:38 the Trump administration like "Nope still 10." Well I mean I don't know what you want people to offer at that point
42:46 This means if they're not negotiating in good faith they are going to get a letter the uh
42:52 saying here here is the rate So I would expect that everyone would come and
42:58 negotiate in good faith You expect that rate though that you would slap on any country that you think is not
43:03 negotiating in good faith to be above 10% Well I think that it would be the April 2nd level Some countries were at
43:10 10% some were substantially higher And the negotiating leverage that President Trump is talking about here is if you
43:18 don't want to negotiate then it will spring back to the April 2nd level
43:23 Okay so if that's still on the table if the April 2nd levels are like 46% tariffs on Vietnam are still on the level um again I think that's an empty
43:31 threat I don't think that Treasury Secretary Bessant wants any of that However to pretend that we are better
43:36 off today in terms of our tariff rates our trade policy than we were on April 1st before liberation day would be to
43:43 maintain ignorance of the current economic plans of the administration Meanwhile the question of whether over
43:48 whether the big beautiful bill gets done before Memorial Day is still on the table So yesterday the House budget
43:55 panel finally did approve the Trump big beautiful bill following some hardliner resistance According to Politico House
44:01 Republicans finally launched their partyline tax and spending package from the budget committee late on Sunday night That was after GOP leaders
44:07 promised some final changes to appease fiscal hawks after a setback on Friday
44:13 Just before the late night markup the speaker huddled privately in a room adjacent to the meeting room with the budget committee Republicans who
44:18 previously blocked the mega bill from advancing That'd be Representatives Chip Roy of Texas Josh Brasheen of Oklahoma And of Georgia and Ralph Norman of South
44:25 Carolina Once the markup reconvened House Budget Chair Jodi Arrington of Texas who's been tasked with shephering
44:30 this thing through said negotiations over changes to the more than 1100page bill are
44:36 ongoing Apparently the promises include speeding up enforcement of several policies in the bill including Medicaid work requirements Nixon green energy tax
44:43 perks enacted during the Biden administration and revoking Medicaid benefits from undocumented
44:48 immigrants All four of those Republicans did not end up voting at all in the committee they just ended up voting
44:54 present which shows that they don't love the bill but they're not going to hold up the bill at this point Whether this
45:00 still passes without any of those changes actually being enshrined remains a a questionable thing Basically as I
45:08 said right at the beginning with the big beautiful bill the choices were going to be between maintenance of the Trump tax cuts and a bunch of crap or
45:15 non-maintenance of the Trump tax cuts and slightly less crap Those were the two choices It was always going to be a
45:21 crap sandwich It was just a a matter of how much actual deli meat was in the sandwich and how much crap was in the
45:26 sandwich And the answer was if you have a big beautiful sandwich more crap more deli meat If you have a if you have a no
45:33 deal then no deli meat and still some crap That that that was kind of the the way to think about all of this This is
45:41 why President Trump is pushing very hard for Republicans to get it done He's starting to weigh in significantly more
45:47 vocally He put out a a statement on Truth Social Quote "Republicans must unite behind the one big beautiful bill
45:54 Not only does it cut taxes for all Americans it will kick millions of illegal immigrants off of Medicaid to protect it for those who are the ones in
45:59 real need The country will suffer greatly without this legislation With their taxes going up 65% it will be blamed on the Democrats but that doesn't
46:05 help our voters We don't need grandstanders in the Republican party Stop talking and get it done It's time to fix the mess that Biden and the
46:10 Democrats gave us Thank you for your attention to this matter." And of course this is the right move from President Trump If the bill does not pass the
46:16 economy is going to crater I mean it is that simple Right now the markets have priced in the current tax rates and
46:23 current regulation If the tax rates spike then what you will see is the
46:28 economy drop Investors will pull their money up because they know that they're going to be paying higher tax It will
46:34 restructure business in the United States again The markets have already priced this in Now does this mean the bill is perfect far from
46:40 it There's a bunch of junk in this bill Like true junk in this bill It is true that our debt problems are out of
46:46 control It is also true that nothing that's currently being proposed would solve our debt problems Russ Ba over at
46:52 Office of Management and Budget he makes the case that this bill is better than what Democrats would have which of course is true I mean again that is like
47:01 saying that that you are a better singer than William Young or whatever his name was the guy from American Idol who could
47:07 who could barely war Like yes this is better than what Democrats would provide Also the current status of my health is
47:15 better than a man dying of gang green Yes Democrats are very very bad at at these particular things But that doesn't
47:20 mean that the one big beautiful bill is going to really bend the cost curve in a significant way Russ VA says the current
47:26 House bill includes 1.6 trillion in savings These are not gimmicks but real reforms that lower spending and improve the program The bill satisfies the very
47:32 redline test that House fiscal hawks laid out a few weeks ago that stated that the cost of any tax cut could be paid for with $2.5 trillion in assumed
47:39 economic growth but the rest had to be covered with savings from reform This bill exceeds that test by nearly $100
47:45 billion $36 trillion in debt is not solved overnight It's solved by advancing and
47:50 securing victories at a scale that over time gives a fighting shot to addressing the problem Okay but what are the actual problems with the bill well it includes
47:58 a bunch of bad spending still on Medicaid Much of the good stuff in the bill only kicks in late
48:06 The Wall Street Journal editorial board points out that it is good that the bill makes the 2017 tax reform
48:14 permanent It's also good that the 2017 reforms 20% deduction for small businesses that pay at the individual
48:20 rate is made permanent However the bill does in fact stealth raise the top marginal tax rate
48:27 by limiting itemized deductions for the 37% top tax bracket
48:33 It also has a bunch of tax cuts for some groups and tax increases for
48:38 others So the bill limits a tip exemption to an occupation which traditionally and customarily receive
48:44 tips before December 31st 2024 Unclear what exactly that means i mean plumbers
48:50 electricians do they actually get tips for example seniors earning up to 75
48:55 grand get an enhanced $4,000 deduction which is a pure vote buying exercise That's on top of the $16,000 standard
49:02 deduction All those tax breaks expire in 2028 By the way this is one of the ways that you hide the cost of bills is you
49:08 say that something's going to sunset that never will sunset You say "Well it's only going to cost a certain amount a certain amount of money over the next
49:14 3 years knowing it will absolutely be green lit for the next 30
49:20 years." The bill also includes an increase I believe in the
49:26 child tax credit They're going to make the $2,000 child tax credit permanent at another 500 bucks through
49:32 2028 Again those are not child tax credits A lot of the people who are getting those credits do not actually
49:38 pay taxes There's an increased $30,000 deduction for salt Bottom line is this Does this make
49:45 major changes on the spending front no Does it have to be passed yes Welcome to
49:50 the world of politics where neither party and basically the American people are not willing to do the actual hard
49:55 work of having serious conversations about our debt crisis Which means eventually we are going to have to go into austerity measures or inflation or
50:02 raise taxes or all three Those are those are the actual options that we're going to hit probably sometime in the next 5
50:08 to 10 years Okay Meanwhile the Supreme Court has now extended its block on President Trump's deportation bid under
50:14 the Alien Enemies Act So they are not ruling that President Trump cannot use the Alien Enemies Act to deport members
50:20 of Trenaragua However the court did put a block on the use of that for the moment
50:27 because they say that the Trump administration has not given them their due process Again this is why I say that I agree with much of what President
50:33 Trump is trying to do but you have to do it in a way that is most likely to be successful It turns out that grabbing
50:39 people and deporting them and then insisting that they remain deported without just bringing them back for a quick hearing before deporting them
50:45 again that is counterproductive It may look strong on the page but it actually plays weak in the Supreme
50:50 Court So the unsigned opinion according to the justices say this means advanced notice of deportation and a meaningful
50:56 opportunity to challenge the deportations in court two justices did descent That'd be
51:03 Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alo saying that this is plenary power of the executive branch The the ruling does not
51:09 say again that President Trump cannot use the Alien Enemies Act It just says that if you're going to use it then you
51:14 actually do have to pay attention to the due process clause of the Constitution So it is not the big victory that the
51:20 Democrats are playing it as It's also not the giant loss that President Trump has been has been suggesting that it is
51:26 Meanwhile in foreign policy news a pretty amazing story out of the Washington
51:31 Examiner about the influence of Qatar So we've been talking about this for several weeks at this point Actually
51:37 going back further than that we've been talking about Qatar and its relationship with Hamas and its relationship with
51:42 al-Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood and all the rest While the Qatari embassy spends a fortune doing outreach that
51:49 outreach has shifted dramatically from the left side of the aisle to the right side of the aisle particularly in the aftermath of President Trump's election
51:54 Well now a piece from the Washington Examiner finds that the Qatari embassy paid a PR firm
52:01 $180,000 per month It's called Luminate Adviserss a registered foreign agent
52:06 They paid them $180,000 a month nearly $2 million a year And the only thing listed on their
52:13 new Farah form is acquiring the interview with Tucker Carlson and the prime minister of
52:19 Qatar According to the official Farah filing the date that this particular PR
52:24 agency and Tucker Carlson agreed to conduct that interview was February 26th one week before the interview aired The
52:31 stated purpose of the interview in the Farah documents was that Qatar was going to get pretty rich massage treatment in
52:39 that interview So again the PR agency was paid a fortune to acquire this this
52:45 interview with Tucker and they did their job They got the interview with Tucker and Tucker gave a very very very very glowing interview with the emir of Qatar
52:51 Again this is just indicative of how much Qatar tries to intervene in American
52:57 politics And prior to election day about 10% of communications from Qatari
53:02 foreign agents to people in politics in the United States were directed at conservatives either outlets or
53:07 commentators After President Trump won that shifted to over 50% of total
53:13 correspondents They tried to do outreach to Fox News Digital Just the News the New York Post the Daily Mail the
53:18 Washington Examiner And Qatar obviously is spreading its money around This is why
53:23 we should all be quite suspicious of the kinds of business deals that Qatar is trying to cut with people in the Trump camp Qatar does not do things without
53:31 strings attached Clearly they have an agenda Pretending they don't have an agenda is an act of willful
53:36 ignorance Okay Meanwhile again it is a mistake for President Trump to be going after media
53:43 outlets that are pointing out that Qatar is spreading its influence this way So
53:50 President Trump went on Truth Social and attacked ABC News Now normally I'm totally up for the attacks on ABC News
53:56 This one happens not to be particularly accurate He says "Why doesn't Chairman Bob Iger do something about the ABC fake
54:01 news especially since I just won $16 million based on the fake and defamatory reporting of little George Sopadopoulos
54:07 he was given warnings but just couldn't be restrained by management Now I see they're added again I again give these sleeves bags fair warning The wonderful
54:13 country of Qatar wonderful country of Qatar is a country of 2.6 million people
54:18 300,000 of which are actual citizens Some 2.3 million are either foreign workers or possible slaves Qatar again
54:26 one of the bigger funders of terrorism on planet Earth and a gigantic funer of propaganda operations in America and
54:32 elsewhere The wonderful country of Qatar says President Trump after agreeing to invest more than $1.4 $4 trillion in the
54:37 United States of America deserves much better than the misleading fake news Everyone including their lawyers has been told that ABC must not say Qatar is
54:44 giving me a free Boeing 747 airplane because they are not Instead and as fake news ABC fully knows and understands
54:50 this highly respected country is donating the plane to the United States Air Force Defense Department not to me By the way ABC News said that they also
54:57 reported that after the plane is used by President Trump it will then go to the Trump Presidential Library That is one of the stipulations of the contract
55:04 That's not their fault If you don't like the deal being reported don't do the deal By the way it's going to be really
55:10 expensive to retrofit that plane They basically have to take it apart piece by piece to make sure that there's no Chinese tech in there In any case the
55:18 situation in the Middle East continues to be quite fraught on a wide variety of fronts It is now perfectly clear for
55:26 example that Hamas the the Israeli Defense Forces are now going into Gaza full boore Kamas has been unwilling to
55:33 sign on to a deal that would free some nine or 10 hostages in return for a couple of months of ceasefire What they
55:39 want is for Israel to simply withdraw from the entire Gaza Strip and hand them a victory based on them holding a few hostages which is not going to happen It
55:45 turns out shock of shocks kamas's actual goal in the October 7th war was to destroy the possibility of an Abraham
55:52 accord between Israel and Saudi Arabia Days before the assault that left nearly 1200 dead according to the Wall Street
55:58 Journal Yakinar Kamas's Gaza chief told fellow mil militants that an extraordinary act was required to derail
56:04 the normalization talks he said risk marginalizing the Palestinian cause according to the document reviewed by the Wall Street
56:10 Journal So they were openly saying that they wanted to sink the Middle East peace process Again these are these are
56:15 the wonderful people so much of the left are backing and and a few on the right Wonderful wonderful people
56:22 Meanwhile Erdogan Taib Rasep Erdogan who is the dictatorial leader of Turkey is
56:28 flexing his power in the Middle East He obviously has been taking over large swaths of Syria in cahoot with HTS the
56:36 terrorist group that we are now relieving sanctions on Again you make the case for relieving sanctions based on some actual normalization procedures
56:42 getting rid of terrorism moderation all the rest There had better be some strings attached to the revocation of Syrian sanctions Erdogan believes he's
56:49 now in control of foreign policy Here he was basically I mean I do have to find
56:55 this hilarious He basically finger trapped Emanuel Mcronone It's so weird So Emanuel Mcronone who's a schmuck of
57:00 schmucks The current president of France He he is a joke of a leader He's
57:06 unpopular in his own country for good reason He has in foreign policy
57:11 consistently provided space for terror supporters Here is Erdogan basically showing physical dominance over the
57:18 president of France by grabbing his fingers and not letting go Very
57:26 weird He grabs his hand and then he just won't let go He's like holding his
57:32 fingers and Mcronone is trying to get free and Erdogan just sits there holding
57:37 his fingers He's still holding his fingers It's super weird Super strange
57:45 Oh my goodness Oh I'm so glad that people like Erdogan have taken plenary control of of Western policy in the
57:52 Middle East apparently And meanwhile the question of an Iran negotiation continues Apparently new negotiations have been set between the United States
57:58 and Iran for this weekend in Rome The question is what is the actual crossover so Steve Whit the special envoy to the
58:04 Middle East As you all know I'm quite skeptical of Steve Whit's magical negotiating abilities Here he was on
58:11 ABC's This Week explaining that the goal of the United States was 0% enrichment
58:17 We cannot allow even 1% of an enrichment capability We've delivered a proposal to
58:23 the Iranians that we think addresses some of this without disrespecting them
58:29 And so that's important We we we we want to um we want to get to a solution here
58:36 and uh and and we think that we will be able to but everything begins for our
58:42 from our uh uh standpoint John with a um a deal that does not include enrichment
58:49 We cannot have that Okay so that's great That should be the
58:54 standard Not just zero enrichment by the way zero capacity for enrichment and meaning no centrifuges no nuclear
59:01 program in Iran Iran Fredbar says no Iranian foreign minister Abbasari told Sky News Arabia quote "Washington
59:07 demands are far removed from the reality of the nuclear negotiations and we will continue uranium enrichment." So what
59:14 exactly is so what what exactly are they negotiating over this is what remains unclear Is it just Iran trying to buy
59:19 time is it the United States trying to forestall the possibility of either an American or an Israeli attack on the
59:26 nuclear facilities all of this remains unclear at this point I'm still struggling to see what the what the
59:31 actual end goal is that seems to be achievable in any way shape or form And if the proposal ends up being something
59:37 like a delayed JCPOA 3 years of no development and then 3 years from now you can do what you want That is a fail
59:42 The United States Senate has already said they will not sign off on anything remotely like that Meanwhile
59:47 negotiations sort of continue over Ukraine I say sort of because President Trump had conversations today with both
59:56 the Ukrainians and the Russians Vice President JD Vance explained there's a
60:02 deadlock in talks to end the war Putin does not know does not know how to get out of the war He said if Russia doesn't cooperate we will eventually announce
60:08 this is not our war Well I mean I don't know what exactly that means This is not our war I mean presumably what that
60:15 means is that the United States will get out of both sides I have a question That's exactly what Vladimir Putin wants
60:22 I mean Putin is hoping the United States gets bored and walks away That is what he wants out of this That is the goal If
60:29 what JD Vance means is something else namely that we'll walk away from the negotiating table and then we'll continue to support Ukraine sufficient
60:35 so they are not overrun by the Russians Agree If what he means is we're going to walk away and basically just abandon
60:42 Ukraine in the face of the Russians that would be a bad policy Totally unclear at this point what any of this means
60:49 Vice President Vance did meet with Ukrainian President Zilinski in Rome on Sunday The meeting at the US ambassador's residence it was also
60:54 attended by the Secretary of State Marco Rubio according to the Washington Post came as world leaders attended the inaugural mass of Pope Leo the 14th
61:01 Silinski described the session as a good meeting Silinski said pressure on Russia must continue until it is ready to stop
61:06 the war He reaffirmed Ukraine's readiness for real diplomacy and stressed the importance of a full and unconditional ceasefire as soon as
61:12 possible Again as I've said Zilinski is doing the stuff that Trump wants him to do Vladimir Putin is not doing the stuff
61:18 that Trump wants him to do Now how successful exactly is the call between
61:23 President Trump and Vladimir Putin Trump had expressed some optimism about this suggesting that he was going to get a
61:29 ceasefire done that Vladimir Putin respects him enough that he will do something along those lines Steve Whit
61:35 was suggesting the same sort of thing Here was WhitF on Sunday I want to be a
61:40 bit more positive about this I believe that the president is going to have a
61:45 successful call with with Vladimir Putin They know each other The president is
61:50 determined to um get something done here and hopefully um if if he can't do it
61:56 then nobody can So uh I leave it to the two leaders to have that call
62:02 So again it's going to be very unclear as to what happens from here But it should be made clear at this point that
62:10 Vladimir Putin does not actually want anything like a negotiated peace that sets the lines where they are He does
62:15 not want that Vladimir Putin believes the United States will eventually walk away And hell if you Vladimir Putin you probably believe that too The United
62:21 States has over the course of the last 20 years walked away from the Kurds the Afghans the people of Hong Kong and now
62:27 maybe the people of Ukraine So why wouldn't they i mean really like that is
62:32 the game that Vladimir Putin is playing He's playing the long game here United States is going to have to play a similarly long game if we actually wish
62:39 for Vladimir Putin not to take over the entirety of Ukraine Meanwhile my friend Dan Banino who is now the deputy
62:45 director of the FBI did a sit down interview over the weekend Dan is fantastic And one of the things I like
62:50 about Dan is that Dan is a truth teller He's just going to tell you the truth whether you like it or not which is again a wonderful thing He did say
62:57 something that he was was on with Cash Patel were talking about how they were quite properly going to go into a deeper
63:03 investigation of Russia gate That of course has been Dan's kind of main focus since 2017 when the media started
63:10 covering Donald Trump as though he was a Russian catpaw So they talked a lot about that But one of the other big sort
63:16 of revelations was Dan Bonino said "Listen now despite all the speculation Jeffrey Epstein did in fact kill
63:21 himself." Okay I'll tell you why I like this The reason I like this is because I'm not a big fan of just pure
63:27 speculation I too have played the did Epstein kill himself game because I mean pretty suspicious But I believe Dan
63:33 Bonino I don't believe he's lying for the deep state If there's one person who can be trusted not to lie for the deep state in fact it would be Dan Bonino
63:39 Here was Dan saying a truthful thing I mean listen they have a right to their
63:46 opinion But as someone who has worked as a public defender as a prosecutor who's been in that prison system who's been in
63:51 the Metropolitan Detention Center who's been in segregated housing um you know a suicide when you see one And that's what
63:57 that was He killed himself You again you want me to get I've I've seen the whole
64:04 file He killed himself Okay So good for Dan Bino This is one of
64:10 the reasons I like having Dan Bonjino in there is because you know Dan ain't going to hide the ball Dan is not going to lie Okay that's true for Cash Patel
64:17 as well but it's certainly true of Dan who I know well So good good for Dan That's good Again transparency is in
64:23 fact the best medicine Okay Meanwhile the Trump administration in other good
64:28 things continues to go after major universities that are absolutely
64:36 promoting anti-American trash and violating the Civil Rights Act At the same time Linda McMahon the Secretary of
64:42 Education she's talking openly about raising taxes on endowments for universities This is this is worthwhile
64:50 It is I mean the the reality is that these universities have become propaganda outlets for a far-left
64:55 viewpoint very often in violation of the Civil Rights Act and treating them with kid gloves is not the way Here is Linda
65:01 McMahon expressing this Let's go back to Harvard for a minute when they have almost a 53 billion
65:07 endowment Now there's a small endowment that tax that's on endowments that's currently in place It's about 1.4% 4%
65:14 and that's you know on uh you know universities that have at least 500 students that are on tuition Uh so
65:21 that's at about uh I think 500,000 per student is kind of the barometer they
65:27 look at uh before the the taxes start So this is really going to increase that
65:33 But uh it's about $2 million uh per people that gets you know
65:38 sort of wave before the taxes start But I it's a ton of money if you look at it
65:45 that is going uh non-t taxed even though universities will say we use most of our
65:51 endowment for student aid and for research Well don't you think that's what they should be using those
65:56 endowment dollars for okay she is right about all this She
66:01 also says you know if Harvard actually wants to make a deal with us so we don't tax their endowment probably should just let us in That would actually be the
66:06 proper solution Well we'd we'd like to see them uh do
66:12 the things we've asked them to to do in the letter We would like for them to let us come in and sit with them and see
66:18 exactly what they're doing Show us what they're doing They're they're doing a lot of talk about the things they're
66:23 doing but you know if they really are doing these things then they should not object to allowing the task force or
66:29 other members that have been assigned to come in and take a look at exactly what they are doing
66:36 Okay So again all of this is proper Harvard should try to cut a deal That's what they should do Harvard
66:42 should absolutely try to cut a deal with the Trump administration and actually abide by you know the Civil Rights Act
66:48 as as they are supposed to do It is truly amazing to me to watch people suggest that violation of the Civil
66:54 Rights Act is perfectly okay so long as it is done against Jews That's the argument anyway Again free speech on
67:00 campus is a thing and should be a thing However the Civil Rights Act does apply
67:06 to federal taxpayer dollars and it doesn't stop applying just because you agree with some of the things that are
67:11 that are creating a an environment of harassment E listen if you don't like the Civil Rights Act in general or you
67:16 don't like its application universities fine with me Let's talk about it I'm open to that But to pretend that the law only applies on one side and doesn't
67:23 apply on the other is simply silly Okay time for diddy watch Listen I know we we
67:29 really only do Diddy watch when it comes to Ben After Dark but the reality is it is kind of a fascinating case It's mostly a fascinating case because this
67:35 is what happens when you have a culture that is so willing to look the other way
67:41 on evil promiscuous disgusting behavior that by the time it reaches the
67:46 level of criminal there are serious questions about the criminality That's the part of this that that really is astonishing because there is an open
67:53 legal question when it comes to the trial of Shaun Diddy Holmes as to whether he committed the crimes that are
67:59 alleged because the crimes that are alleged are trafficking not him being a complete piece of bleep which he clearly
68:06 clearly is And so that's actually the defense The defense that Diddy's team is currently running is that Diddy is a
68:12 piece of crap but he's not a piece of crap who's trafficked And one of the problems that that the prosecution is
68:18 going to have in this case is that he is fully admitting to for example beating up his girlfriend But there's a
68:25 difference between that and cross state lines trafficking And if all these people
68:31 consented to this terrible treatment and kept coming back for more of this terrible treatment for the money how
68:36 criminal is it that is the question that the defense is leaving on the table Again none of that is a go-ahehead for his activity But we have lost in our
68:43 society the capacity at all to distinguish between the consensual and the moral We have decided that if
68:48 something is consensual it is therefore moral Now again there's there's sort of three categories here Consensual moral and legal Okay Very often something that
68:56 is consensual is immoral but also legal But we have decided basically because as
69:01 a country we are more secular now and because as a country we no longer believe in morality and legality being
69:07 separate in any serious way Kind of on both sides It's very strange We now
69:13 determine that if we don't like what somebody did it must be illegal Even if it was you know immoral
69:20 and not illegal it has to be illegal Like moral and legal are the same category now We're conflating the two categories Again this is not a legal
69:26 defense of Shan Combmes Again we're still getting all the evidence but that's the defense that he is making
69:32 According to the Wall Street Journal faced with a mountain of video and photographic evidence of their clients violence toward women the defense strategy is to own the bad behavior
69:38 rather than make excuses At the same time his lawyers are trying to make clear domestic violence isn't the same as
69:43 trafficking Candidly acknowledging Clolome's flaws might bear fruit in winning credibility with the jury According to defense lawyers who aren't
69:48 involved in the case "If you defend the infensible the jury isn't going to believe anything you say," said Moira Penza a former federal prosecutor and
69:54 partner at the law firm at Wilkinson Stlo So again did he's already taken the
70:00 reputational hit So why wouldn't he actually just say "Yeah I I engaged in
70:05 all this gross and terrible behavior but it's not criminal." Sarah Kristoff a former
70:10 federal prosecutor said lawyers for Combmes know they can't get around the video or Cassie Ventur's detailed testimony of her toxic relationship with
70:18 Diddy The legal argument she said Comolmes did bad things but not these bad things This is according to the Wall Street Journal Prosecutors told the jury
70:25 in their opening statements that as proof of the racketeering conspiracy they would show that Combmes committed kidnapping arson and bribery As one
70:31 example Combmes bribed Intercontinental Security staff with $100,000 in an attempt to keep video surveillance
70:36 footage of his hotel hallway attack on Ventura under wraps They allege prosecutors will also likely point to Ventura's testimony as proof of the
70:43 conspiracy charge which involves showing Combs and those in his inner circle agreed to commit crimes as part of the group She told jurors he had a security
70:49 team take her to a plastic surgeon after she suffered a gash to her head during one of the attacks
70:55 But Holmes' lawyers are going to try to argue both instances were consistent by their defense with with their defense
71:00 saying he didn't do those independently He was trying to cover up his abuse So yes he was abusive and yes he did those things but he wasn't doing bribery for
71:07 the sake of doing bribery He was basically doing this stuff because he wanted to cover up what exactly the
71:12 underlying crime was which was you know actual domestic violence It's sort of a fascinating case again
71:19 because what we actually should have just said years and years and years ago is that people in Hollywood are
71:24 disgusting vile and disgusting But we've fallen into this trap now of if a woman
71:30 stays with a man for long periods of time after he demands she does these degrading degrading
71:35 things that somehow all of that would be okay except for the criminality It was
71:40 never okay What he did was not okay What she did in staying with him was not okay
71:46 And we would be much better off in a society that did not suggest that the consensual and the moral were the exact
71:51 same thing because they absolutely are not Meanwhile apparently Diddy is actively working for a Donald Trump pardon Oh boy I don't think that's going
71:58 to happen I I I have a hard time believing that's going to happen But Kanye West who in his spare time when
72:05 he's not building shrines to Hitler has publicly appealed to President Trump for a pardon sharing on X President Trump
72:11 please free my brother Puff Wow that sounds just awesome Now Holmes has
72:18 praised President Trump in the past In 2015 he said "Donald Trump is a friend of mine and he works very hard." But
72:25 their relationship turned sour because in June 2017 did he admit it according to The Mirror I think that to be honest
72:31 we really don't give an F about Trump because black people are in the same effed up position That's not what we're on The tom foolery going on in DC that's
72:36 just regular everyday business to black folks That's not surprising Uh I I do not think that a pardon is forthcoming
72:43 for P McDy I I don't think that is likely to happen All righty folks The show is continuing for members right now
