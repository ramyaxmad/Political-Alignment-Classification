00:01 welcome everybody uh today I am really pleased uh to have on our podcast
00:07 Alexandria arazo Cortez who represents the 14th District of New York State uh
00:15 Alexandria thanks so much for being with us of course thank you it's always great uh being together and and chatting
00:21 Bernie thank you for having me okay um look there's a lot that's going on uh
00:27 let me start off with a question that I don't know you get asked very often talk
00:33 a little bit not just about your background you know as a kid growing up where you went to school but how your
00:39 background impacted your politics today yeah I mean I I was born in the Bronx in late ' 80s
00:51 and um to two Puerto Rican parents my
00:56 dad was born when the Bronx was burning and well he was born and was and grew up
01:03 while the Bronx was burning and my mom was born in a very very um poor and
01:10 rural area in Puerto Rico and so um even when the Bronx was
01:16 burning and what my dad was seeing people don't often talk about why and a lot of it was landlords setting fire to
01:24 their own buildings um sometimes with families inside um in order to recoup
01:31 Insurance costs and um and because the
01:36 property values were going down because black and brown families were moving into the neighborhood and Robert Moses
01:42 was building the Cross Bronx Expressway it was always and so often the result of
01:49 these larger systems at play that resulted in a lot of
01:55 the economic exploitation and you know material
02:01 hardship that we were um that and that that families were were confronted with
02:06 and so when I talk about my story I feel like there's no there's no story of me
02:11 without the story of my parents um my mom was born in a very rural and poor
02:16 area of Puerto Rico and they survived just unspeakable levels of poverty and
02:25 destitution um and survived and my mom met my dad he was he flew back to Puerto
02:33 Rico to visit his family and she was a girl next door and that's where their
02:39 story began and a couple of years later um well they got married moved back to
02:44 the Bronx and I was born and I was born in the Bronx in a one-bedroom apartment in parchester and um this was a time
02:54 when the Bronx had about 50% Dropout rates in its schools it was completely
03:02 abandoned our its children were completely abandoned and my parents felt that in order for me to have a shot our
03:09 whole extended family had to chip in and um try to see if we could move to a
03:14 different zip code that had a school system um that that they didn't feel
03:20 that I would be doomed in W and um your
03:25 parents were very conscious of the need to get you a decent education absolutely it it it is what shaped so much of their
03:33 decisions um was my ability to get a decent public education and um so they
03:40 my whole extended family and it wasn't just my parents my aunts my uncles everybody chipped in wow and helped my
03:47 parents get a down payment on a very small house 40 minutes north from where
03:53 we lived and um I went to public school and I went to public school but I also
03:58 had cousins the the same exact age as I was that didn't have the same opportunity and I was and
04:06 we were all very close culturally even though we're cousins we kind of grow up like siblings and it was really
04:15 conscious for me I was very aware from the time I was very very young about the
04:22 difference in reality and opportunity between me and my cousins wow and it was
04:29 very deeply ingrained in me that the ZIP code we lived in determined a lot about
04:36 our destiny and I knew from a very young age that that was wrong I always just
04:42 felt this really kind of unconscious sense I think when you're
04:49 a child and you see Injustice you know that something is off but you you don't
04:54 have the words to articulate it and I felt that way I felt that my my cousins
05:00 and other members of my family other children of my family were just as smart as I was just as talented as I was but
05:08 they didn't have books in their schools and they didn't have teachers that cared for them and I knew that the opport our
05:16 differences an opportunity were not a result of our character or anything or how hard we worked it was a result of of
05:24 just where we lived and um you know even
05:29 then it was still hard for my family my mom uh was was a house cleaner and um my
05:38 dad was trying to small was trying to start a small business um and we had a
05:43 lot of hardship growing up and um you know I often cleaned houses with my mom
05:51 and sometimes I'd be cleaning the houses of other kids that I went to school with
05:56 you know was that a strange experience yeah I mean it it some it was and like
06:02 also there's a there's of course there's the class element there's also a racial element I was like one of the only
06:08 nonwhite kids in my school and so it was very othering right like and this was a
06:15 time when when the town that I lived in was also quickly kind of evolving from a
06:24 very working class area into more of a suburb like more of a bis suburb and
06:32 so um what that meant was that there was just a lot of class differences racial
06:38 differences that were blooming during this time and um you know it's it
06:44 becomes really apparent and obvious which kids have like the nice sneakers
06:50 and you know what I'm saying like I know exactly what you're saying when when who
06:56 is wearing and re-wearing the clothes a little bit more often and you know and that like who has five shirts who has a
07:04 lot more you know it's funny cuz I had a similar experience wearing the what do they call hand me-- Downs it's called
07:11 and you don't forget that and you do know which family can afford the nice sakers that you can't afford all right
07:17 take us from that extraordinary experience uh to how you got involved in
07:24 politics well I um I grew up a lot um
07:29 going between Westchester and the Bronx and so you start to kind of see politics
07:37 emerge and how it starts to play a role in your life as you you know become a teenager and then uh for me in college
07:43 and I moved back to the Bronx after I graduated college you know my parents
07:50 did everything they could I went to public school I graduated I went to Boston University graduated bu and I
07:57 decided that I wanted to go back to the Bronx and organize around early
08:03 childhood education because I felt that I didn't know what I wanted to do this was right
08:11 after you know post recession this was around 2011 and um and I was I felt incensed
08:21 about the extension of the Bush tax cuts when uh during the Obama presidency it
08:28 was actually very r radicalizing and shocking to me when I saw that when I
08:33 was in college it was that I was like how could we reward the people who did
08:43 this and abandon the millions of people who've been victimized by
08:51 this massive economic crime it was it it was shocking to me and um I
09:01 moved back uh to to the Bronx and I was also felt very I felt very cynical about
09:10 the politics in the Bronx this was a time when this is also where I saw a lot of the time of the the limits of
09:19 just a very superficial kind of racial identity politics where we were
09:25 electing sure lots of local politicians who were Latino and and and and black
09:33 and Al and just like a great racial diversity but they still ascribed to the
09:40 same corruption and the same um the the same just like pay for play politics
09:47 that every other generation and what we had seen for very for a very long time this kind of this level the color of the
09:54 skin was a little different yeah exactly and it it it supercharged that kind of
10:00 cynicism right um and not only that but a lot of them were getting arrested for it they were getting
10:06 caught and it just became this thing of like and it wasn't just me I think there was just this community sense of like
10:13 this is not worth a damn and so I was actually very much opposed to any idea
10:20 of getting involved in electoral politics beside I mean I would vote but uh outside of that I felt that politics
10:28 is just a place for wealthy people and connected people and corrupt people and
10:33 I am neither one of those things and I I even if I wanted to lie I'm not a
10:40 good liar I just felt that it wasn't for me I felt much more satisfied going into more
10:49 direct organizing families working with families I worked with the national Hispanic Institute I worked with young
10:55 people around how we can organize and improve our schools and improve our education um but then at that time also
11:02 um you know the when I was in college my father had gotten sick he passed away
11:08 and so my mom was a became a single mom and um and we were on the brink of
11:14 foreclosure ourselves as a result of both the financial crisis and uh a
11:21 personal financial crisis with the healthcare cost of my dad going through chemotherapy and everything like that
11:27 and so um I I quit my job and
11:34 I because I had to help provide for myself and my family and working
11:41 restaurants at that time you make cash you bring home cash every day um you can
11:48 have more control over what you bring home as opposed to just a a salary job
11:53 like you can pick up extra shifts you can do all these other things and that's what I did and what tending bars and
12:01 yeah I waitressed I tended bar I I that's what I did not for a summer but
12:08 for four to five years of my life Wow and um it's actually there and my
12:15 experience doing that and my family's experience that led me to that that was
12:21 the most important formative political experience of my life all right and jump to a decision to run for the US Congress
12:28 against all the odds yeah I mean I think um you know spending all of that time
12:35 working in restaurants I felt like it was really a crucible of so many different political issues despite the
12:42 ACA being passed neither me nor anyone I worked with had
12:48 healthcare because it was too expensive um most of the people that
12:54 were preparing food for other people to eat were undocumented
13:00 uh the food costs were a result of you know these big a oligopolies and how all
13:08 those costs get passed on to Little People they're just on and on and on and on the the the the tipped minimum wage
13:15 you know I would get my check once a week my paycheck and I would I would
13:22 peel back the paper and unfold it and I would see the check having 50 cents in
13:27 it every week because you have to report your tips and they take I mean it was it this it just
13:35 living life in America is radicalizing as a workingclass American and so um
13:43 after years of that well I think first of all in 2016 you ran and it
13:50 was I don't think from from the shirts and and and the
13:57 dirty sneakers that you have as a kid to you know opening that check and
14:03 seeing 50 cents in it we normalize this to ourselves we
14:10 accept it and I think really deep down the
14:15 unconscious rationale that we give ourselves to accept this
14:20 is this is what I deserve like this or this is
14:26 what this is my lot this is what I get right and when you ran in
14:34 2016 and we talked and the way it wasn't that you talked about Healthcare it was the way you talked about Healthcare it
14:40 was the first time that I heard an elected leader
14:46 say everybody deserves Health Care in this
14:53 country by the fact that they are born a human being that it is in a sense essential
14:60 right of our dignity and existence especially living in the wealthiest
15:06 nation in the history of this world and it broke my brain a little bit
15:13 seeing that on a television and I was literally wiping a glass from behind a bar and I I I didn't
15:22 even realize that I didn't think I deserved
15:27 health care until I heard someone say that I did and then hearing that I was
15:35 like why don't we have these things this is right this is we are
15:41 living in an absurdity getting a 60c paycheck makes no
15:48 sense and it was very radicalizing for me and um and you know not only that and
15:58 I'm not saying this just to blow smoke at you go ahead you're doing great but also when you were the first
16:07 presidential candidate to come to the Bronx since Bobby Kennedy in
16:13 1968 and you know what you may not know this we were told not to go there been a
16:19 murder in the area a few within the week and the cops said look this you know we don't it's
16:26 not a good idea there going to be disturbances and everything else it was a wonderful event it was and I I I
16:33 volunteered I didn't know that I volunteered thank you very much you're welcome you're welcome we helped set it
16:38 up we helped you know we we had uh we we
16:44 had like a you know the campaign set up like a uh an office an organizing office and I was there 500 a.m. we're hanging
16:52 door hangers on people's doors before 10,000 people something and we had and there was overflow and it was
16:60 it it was so important because prior to that there were only you were the you
17:05 were the first since Bobby Kennedy as a candidate but the only other in between
17:10 that time was Ronald Reagan who came to the South Bronx and and compared it to
17:16 Dresden and left to post World War II Dresden and left
17:21 and you're going there really like it was it was shocking because nobody cares
17:30 about us we're a deep blue community in a deep blue City in a deep blue State
17:39 there is no electoral incentive to care about
17:44 us and you went there and we're a burrow
17:50 that doesn't have the highest vote turnout either because of the cynicism because of this internalized apathy and
17:59 I was like holy  we're doing it we're we're making
18:06 ourselves matter we're making ourselves matter and um and that was such a
18:13 fantastic day in St Mary's Park and I was one of the volunteers there we
18:18 helped advance and set up the event and then I got to be part of the crowd and
18:25 um and it really meant something to me and after that race I I dove back into
18:34 organizing I I uh got involved um with black lives matter I went to Standing
18:42 Rock um in order to fight the Keystone XL pipeline and it was after those
18:47 experiences that I had kind of felt for me I think that my family my background
18:55 the way that I'm raised and also what is informed my politics even intellectually is very
19:03 much the spiritual undercurrent of of a left politics especially in
19:10 America liberation theology the Civil Rights Movement was your family Catholic
19:16 my my family my family well my father's Catholic I was raised Catholic and my mother my mother's side of the family in
19:22 Puerto Ric was more Pentecostal and so um I had felt at that
19:28 point that I was just I felt ready to just devote myself in a much Fuller sense in
19:37 my life to a greater struggle for justice and I didn't know what that
19:43 meant um and then uh there was then people started calling attention to our
19:48 local congressman who was a party boss I remember looking him up and my
19:57 family's lived in the Bronx for over 30 for I mean way longer than 30 years but
20:02 like since I was born but my my dad too since he was born and I remember looking
20:08 up this guy and I was like I've never seen this man in my life like not once
20:15 ever I was like who is this and I kind of thought you know if I haven't seen
20:24 him and if I don't know who he is then I know that no one else knows who you're
20:31 talking about Joe Crowley who was an upand cominging leader yeah in the
20:36 Democratic establishment here in Washington yeah and um I I started to dig
20:43 into what the deal was here cuz how does a person that is just completely unknown
20:50 become the congressman and I saw and I started to follow the money of what was going on and even though he was not very
20:59 welln in the community he was extremely wellknown and extremely powerful among
21:05 the New York City political Elite he was not only The Heir Apparent to the
21:10 speakership in the US House of Representatives he was also the chairman of the Queens County Democratic party
21:18 which is a very which was arguably the strongest political machine in all of New York City and so he not only had
21:26 National politics but he also he built that that path to National
21:31 politics by really being a powerful player in the New York City real EST and how old were you at this time at this
21:38 time when I was looking at this I was probably 26 or 27 so you decided to take on a guy who was going to come the speaker of the house and the leader of
21:44 the Queens Democratic party right yeah yeah why not and I think the reason for
21:49 it was um twofold no one else would was
21:55 quite as crazy as he was yeah no one else would do it um it it was clear that anybody who wanted any future in
22:01 politics uh would never do this and I wasn't particularly attached to a future in
22:07 politics so I and we hadn't had a primary election in 14 years because
22:12 this machine would intimidate bully people out sue them off the ballot and it became really apparent that the only
22:20 kind of person that would run would be a complete and total long shot with no
22:27 chance so I said my goal was if we at
22:33 least had a choice if we at least forced the first primary election in 14 years
22:39 in this community then that will have been a service like let's just see if we can
22:44 get on the ballot this a funny story so you got on
22:51 the ballot and what happen on the ballot and guess what this is important because
22:57 a lot of people like to tell is history about it and I understand there was a lot of people that played a role in in
23:03 that Victory but getting on the ballot I was totally alone with just the few
23:11 Scrappy people in the neighborhood that were crazy enough to believe that this was worthwhile we W endorsed by almost
23:19 anybody and not only that but I mean truly the people who were collecting
23:26 signatures in that time were just people in the neighborhood and I had no money
23:34 like none at all I had a a paper grocery bag
23:40 with with um a clipboard and you know
23:46 stuff that I keep behind the bar I'd work my shift i' take my bag with my clipboard out and then I go out across
23:53 the Bronx and queens it was it was lunacy it was lunacy
23:59 but um there were enough people that we
24:05 were able to organize at that point that we collected the signatures to get on the ballot and not only that we
24:11 collected about six or seven times that um so that they couldn't sue us off they couldn't throw us off and after I got on
24:18 the ballot then and we met our first goal which was to force the first primary
24:24 election uh in 14 years um people started paying more attention to it and
24:32 I kept messaging I think really at the end of the day the core the
24:40 core goal and the core message of our campaign was that we deserve
24:46 better it was to try to spread the gospel on this which is
24:53 that we don't have to justify being able to afford to live we
25:01 shouldn't have to justify or need some convoluted argument as to why people should be paid enough
25:09 all right so you started the campaign people thought you crazy yeah no chance at all to win yeah and on Election Day
25:17 what happened so on Election Day I never allowed myself to even
25:26 um imagine myself winning because it felt way too crazy but I also
25:32 never imagined myself losing either I just imagined myself getting to
25:37 8:59 p.m. the minute before the polls close and then just what happens happens
25:43 um but that day earlier that day we were canvasing going around I remember we
25:48 were going around to the polls making sure everything's okay and that day I was walking down the street and this car
25:56 this family um was driving down the street and there were all these kids inside and I was
26:02 walking down the street and this local family they they look out the window and they honk and they go Alexandria we just
26:07 voted for you and that's when I was like wait we could win this thing we could
26:15 win this thing and um so the polls close 8:59 p.m. and I get in the car and my
26:25 friends are driving the car and my mom's in there with me and I'm so so nerv nous and my mom's cell phone starts going off
26:31 and it's ping ping ping but I didn't know what the results were and I was like Mom can you just silence your phone
26:37 for a second I was like so nervous and we get out of the car um and I was so nervous we didn't
26:45 even have a location for a watch party my friend just like let's just meet at the Billiards Hall and we go to
26:53 the Billiards hul and we ask them to put it on up on the screen and we go up and
26:58 not only am I winning but we were up like 10 points all right there's a lot
27:04 nothing a lot things to be learned from what Alexandria just said and that is in
27:11 many ways what the establishment is about is a lot of money people talking to each
27:19 other but if you can organize at the Grassroots level and she's outspent 100 to one or something it ain't much there
27:26 MH I mean there really isn't they have wealth they have power but there aren't many of them and bottom line is and I
27:34 saw that in my presidential campaign took on Hillary oh my God it's the entire Democratic establishment why are you even running turns out they're just
27:41 not many of them yeah uh and they are very far removed in many ways from the
27:46 realities of working people's lives so I mean what Alexandria's story
27:52 is about is not only an extraordinary story about you know what she has accomplished but I think it's a lesson
27:58 for for uh everybody and sometimes we become a little bit pessimistic about
28:03 the state of the world and where we are politically but when you have people willing to take on big money uh willing
28:10 to do Grassroots organizing who come from you know the working class
28:16 themselves uh we can accomplish great things all right I want to switch gear now um I know that you and I have been
28:26 criticized uh for uh our support of President Biden M you disagree with him
28:32 over what's going on in Gaza I strongly disagree with him as well I am also
28:38 supporting his reelection why are you supporting Joe Biden for president well
28:43 I think um to me I look at
28:50 this through an analysis of power and an analysis of
28:56 conditions um I think that I mean when we look at the
29:05 conditions that are available to us in terms of what is most receptive to mass movement
29:12 politics I think and I maintain that it is
29:18 unequivocal that um mass movements have been able to be
29:24 more effective under Joe Biden presidency than Donald Trump
29:29 presidency um and I also know
29:37 that when we look at the horrors of what is happening in Gaza that
29:43 um that people's feelings and understanding about this is is
29:50 completely understandable and Justified um and I think that it is uh
29:58 you know it that there are multiple things that can be true at the same
30:05 time that we can see this war machine at work and the way that it it um
30:16 operates and puts so many innocent lives in Peril and we can also see how the
30:23 nlrb has issued some of the most radical Pro labor policies that in other words
30:29 what I think you're saying is in so many words at least what I'm saying is a reelecting Trump would be a
30:38 total disaster for this country and unical and that you know Biden has
30:45 accomplished some good and important things you and I were together with him talking about the climate cause
30:51 something I know you've worked on uh since you got elected to congress and I worked
30:57 on solar panels making solar panels affordable to working class Americans he
31:02 is the first president ever to walk on a picket line making it very clear he is pro worker very strongly
31:09 pro-union uh and when you talk about this election I hope everybody understands uh if Trump is
31:17 elected uh the right of women to control their own bodies is we're going to be on
31:22 the not not only is it gone we will they are talking about active pursuit of
31:29 criminalization right unbelievable putting women in jail right talking
31:35 about climate change I would hope that most of our viewers understand that climate change not only is real but
31:40 unless there's World cooperation the kind of planet with leaving future Generations is very much in
31:47 question Donald Trump thinks the climate change is a hooks Biden has put more
31:52 money into Transforming Our Energy System than any president uh in history so I think
31:59 you know what Alexandria is saying and what I'm saying is yeah we have disagreements with Biden some of them
32:04 very strong uh but he has done some good things and the hope is that if we
32:10 mobilize at the Grassroots level we're going to get him to do better things in the future but you know as I said many times
32:18 Joe Biden is not running against God he's not running against some perfect candidate far from it he's running
32:24 against the most dangerous president in American history and you know bottom line is you have in uh Trump somebody
32:32 who really has spent much of his life in recent years undermining American
32:38 democracy we know our democracy is far from perfect it's corrupt in many re
32:44 ways super packs with billionaire funding elect terrible people can we
32:49 know right now they're going against our friends right they're going to lot of money trying to defeat people who are standing up on this war who are standing
32:56 up for workers rights that's what a super pack p is doing right now but if you have a trump elected
33:04 president all of that is going to be multiplied a dozen times over and literally the foundations of American
33:09 democracy in this country and working with right-wing extremists all over the world the the experiment in democracy
33:16 only a couple hundred years old maybe over and maybe we'll go back to the
33:21 authoritarian form of government that existed for so long so I know that you know a lot of progressives are
33:26 struggling with this issue 100% And I get it uh but I would ask people to take
33:33 a look at the alternative and to do the best that we can do yeah and I think also because I I deeply understand and
33:42 have felt this idea of you know we're sick of
33:47 having to choose between the lesser of two evils and to that I also say it's not just
33:57 about this it's also looking and and trying to
34:02 actively support who people feel are heroes in our democracy because we can
34:08 do both of these things at at the same time you have Jamal Bowman who's up against huge corporate money in
34:15 Westchester County who is standing up and doing courageous things we have more members of Congress now that have that
34:24 are willing to Buck The Establishment than we have had in decades it was just no not in decades ever all right I want
34:31 to say this sorry I know a little bit about this just a bit I was elected uh
34:37 to the US House from Vermont in 1991 took office in ' 91 helped form the
34:42 progressive caucus at that point you know how many people we had five all right I mean I once talked
34:50 to Raul grala about this and he said the the progressive caucus when we started
34:55 it was like me and Bernie and Barb Le and it was basically a gome Chomsky book
35:00 club something like that and now you have almost 100 including something
35:06 extraordinary some of the best and brightest and strongest members of
35:11 Congress in the modern history of this country and I know again when people get pessimistic about politics there has
35:17 never been never been more strong progressors often younger people people of color than ever so we should be very
35:25 proud of and that's what the Progressive Movement has accomplished but I here's here's where I have a question is that I
35:32 think that that's true and I actually think that the
35:38 greatest trick that the establishment plays on us is trying to convince us that we're not winning when we
35:43 are um in order to get us to give up but you went through such a long time of
35:54 actual deep extreme
35:59 marginalization oh marginalization for a very long time you want to talk about marginalization and I want to know why
36:06 didn't you give up when you were one out of 435 all right let's talk about
36:13 modularization all right marginalization is getting elected to the US House
36:18 defeating an incumbent okay and people of Vermont were very generous and I'll tell you a story about that
36:24 election well like in my state at least people do not like negativity they don't
36:30 and they respond against that and my opponent became very negative and their backfire them Etc all right anyhow get
36:35 elected I had been in touch after I got elected with the Democratic Leadership and saying okay look I'm an independent
36:42 I'm that's how I was elected that's how I will be but obviously I expect the function within the Democratic caucus
36:47 right no problem Bernie you're delighted to have you come in there well got elected go to Washington and for the
36:54 first time in my life I I know I date myself here turns out they had been able
36:60 to research all of the things that I had said over the years about Democrats and somebody spread it around the caucus
37:07 conservative Democrat and Democrat said well you know we're not quite so sure we may want you in the CAU I went first
37:14 through the first few weeks of being a member of the Congress I didn't have committee assignments wow I didn't have
37:21 a place to sit I mean wow uh and uh I chose the Committees I chose were with
37:27 good progressives you remember my Henry Gonzalez that name anything from Texas a really strong Progressive and John kany
37:34 from Michigan of course those are the Committees I wanted to be on and it took weeks and weeks before they allowed me
37:41 to sit on that committee was it was it uh Energy and Commerce or it was Banking
37:48 and government oper but was called now called government operations so like oversight so we had the same committee
37:55 assignment our freshman turn fincial services and oversight but you at least got seated I I mean I got seated faster
38:02 than you did but you got there I I did so that's called that's called marginalization all right um and that
38:10 was on day one yeah that was on day that was a hi welcome to the Congress but we can't put you on any
38:16 committee so all right life goes on all right I want to take us um but why did you stay I mean that that to me I'll
38:23 tell you why I say now what am I going to do walk away from the people of Vermont to with elected me uh for but
38:29 for years to deal with that well I stayed for many of the reasons that you
38:34 described earlier I grew up in a family that didn't have any money we lived in a rent control Department in
38:41 Brooklyn I also saw kids who had fancier sneakers nicer homes and everything else
38:47 and it did not seem just uh to me uh and I also saw something you know
38:55 what we don't talk about enough as a society is what stress stress oh my gosh all right and stress
39:01 has a lot to do with economics you know this absolutely people are wondering how they're going to feed their kids if the
39:09 landlord raises the rent you got to take your kid out of school find another school to put that kid in what's
39:15 happening to your parents you talked about your dad becoming ill bills piling up half a million people go bankrupt in
39:20 this country because a medically related bills well my family had that tress so here was my father who came to from
39:27 Poland to America at the Agee of 17 with without a nickel in its pocket okay it
39:33 became a very proud America never made any money but the idea that he could raise two kids with a roof over his head
39:39 without anti-Semitism wow absolutely my mother on the other hand her parents came from
39:45 I think with Russian Poland area she wanted more cuz she was born in America
39:51 Sahar my father was very content and never made much money but he made money he had a job my mother wanted a house of
39:58 her own that's what her dream was she didn't want to live in a rent control Department what was her dream she never
40:04 achieved it she died young uh so and the tension in our family always revolves
40:12 around money my mom wanted this we can't afford this can we do this can you buy this arguments and when you're a kid I
40:18 don't know about your household oh yeah but the arguments SE oh yeah you know
40:23 and you know and that's what I experienced and I think that's what millions of people experienc right now just tremendous stress so you know
40:31 that's one of the factors that said no I'm I ain't going to give up some yeah
40:36 that's it yeah all right now I'm going to ask you another question that is not often
40:44 asked you and I are self-defined as Democratic socialists
40:49 okay so what does that mean what's your vision for America what would you like to see if things worked out the way
40:56 you'd like uh um it's funny to ask this question because I was in a I was in a
41:03 congressional um kind of meeting kind of hearing earlier
41:10 today and I'm I'm sitting on the DI and uh and it was about technology and Ai
41:17 and all of this and this congressman who was uh on on a higher di
41:23 I he says it completely straight face totally seriously he says
41:31 there's something about our economic system here where all of the gains seem
41:40 to be going just to the very top shock of all shocks yes and he's
41:48 like I don't know what it is about this but um it does seem to be a problem that
41:55 we need to address and that is why I am a Democratic
42:01 Socialist yes because I believe that um that the people who
42:09 create value and wealth and work in our
42:14 society and our economy deserve many more of the fruits of their
42:20 labor and that I believe that democracy is not just for ballot boxes but it is
42:27 for our economy I believe that workers should not check their rights at the
42:33 door of their workplace I believe that um people should be able to
42:41 have economic rights I believe that um we must protect
42:48 the essential Dignity of letum and I think what Alexandria is saying it goes back by the way to 1936 you know said
42:57 that Franklin Del Roso and basically in paraphrasing what he said is look it's great we have a Bill of Rights we have
43:02 political rights you can vote every two years every four years that's great but people deserve economic rights and this
43:08 is a radical statement you hold it I hold it are people entitled to healthc care as a human right well yeah yes are
43:16 all people regardless of their income entitled to good education from Child Care through graduate school if they want that whe they want to go to
43:22 training school whatever they want yeah they are people entitled to decent housing yeah yeah I think so mhm and the
43:30 point is living in the richest country in the history of the world this is not some
43:36 utopian fantasy it's not this can be done you talk about AI so the question I
43:41 don't know what your committee meeting was about AI has the potential to
43:47 increase productivity exponentially who's going to benefit from that is it going to continue to go to the 1% and
43:53 the CEOs who are already incredibly wealthy so you know folks what we are
43:59 talking about is not fantasy it is concrete reality you live in a very very wealthy society which today has more
44:07 income and wealth inequality than ever ever existed in the history of America all right that's the reality three
44:13 people on top only more wealth in the bottom half of American sty you happy with that is that good 60% of people
44:19 live in paycheck to paycheck struggling to put food on on the table can we do better of course we can do better but to
44:26 do better you know without Andrea has done for a whole life is take on very very powerful special interest who are
44:33 delighted with the status quo they think the status quo is just great political system is great you're a billionaire
44:39 let's spend a few hundred million dollars defeating somebody economic system is great my company is just
44:44 making huge profits all right that's what we're taking on and I think it's it's an important it's an important point to
44:51 bring up what the alternative is if we do not assert ourselves and enshrine our
44:58 rights and demand health care and education and the underpinings of what of of dignity because if we do not
45:06 assert this the alternative is barbarism who said that way back with
45:13 you tell me a woman a Rosa Luxenberg that's right and she said and she did
45:18 this after the horrors of World War I MH when tens of millions of people were killed and she's right mhm either we're
45:25 going to have a Cooperative Society where we and love each other or you're going to have a handful of people on top
45:30 whose greed is their religion which is what which is what we are contending
45:36 with now the fact that people are choosing between medicine and rent is
45:43 barbarism the fact that people are worried about whether they will be on
45:49 the street every four weeks is barbarism the fact that every time a person has an
45:57 ache or a pain in their body and they're scared that it could either be uh uh it
46:02 could either be just a sore joint or cancer but they can't find out because they can't afford the doctor this is
46:10 barbarism and if we do not demand and not only demand but
46:17 win unions Health Care wages ending endless war then we will condemn
46:25 ourselves to barbarism and I refuse to give up I
46:30 refuse to to submit myself to that future that's not a
46:37 life and so to live we have to fight for each other and we have to stand with
46:43 each other and we have to fight for this vision and this world and you know
46:50 whether I I mean whether we live to see it or not I believe we will but at the
46:57 end what matters is what is is what we dedicated ourselves to and that's to me
47:03 is what makes it both successful and valuable and folks on that
47:10 note I want to thank Alexandra uh not only for being here but be for being an
47:16 incredible inspiration to so many millions of young people you're playing
47:21 an enormously important role thank you very much well Bernie I want to thank you because I think your story is my
47:29 story and my story is your story and now we're sounding like old politicians thaning each other they it's true it's
47:36 true you're all you know brushing It Off Your Shoulder but it's millions of
47:42 people's lives have changed just from hearing you let alone the victories that you've had and the material changes that
47:49 you've made in people's lives including mine and my families so I want to thank you I don't think I would have had
47:54 Healthcare as a kid I I had I had child I was on Child Healthcare Plus in New York I don't know if I would have been
48:00 able to see a doctor if it wasn't for you fighting for me before I knew who you even were so thank you thank you all
48:07 right folks that's it see you allw soon take care all right I'm cutting what was that
48:13 that was fantastic thank you okay great
